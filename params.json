It has the following features:\r\n\r\n**Precise**.  Athabasca Recon includes an ImageJ plug-in for optimal alignment of the input projections.  It allows you to identify and correct even tiny errors in the center of rotation or the rotation axis.  Athabasca Recon also implements a number of methods to correct for beam power decay.\r\n\r\n**Fast**. It is fully multi-threaded, and makes full use of all available processing cores.\r\n\r\n**Memory efficient**. Athabasca Recon will use as much memory as you\r\nspecify (defaults to slightly less than the amount of physical system memory), but\r\nis not limited at all in the size of models in can reconstruct, regardless\r\nof the memory limit.  Projection data are streamed and never loaded\r\nall into memory at once, reducing the required memory.\r\n\r\n**Cross-platform**. It has been compiled on OS X, Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\nBecause it was created to process synchrotron tomographic data, it currently only handles parallel beam reconstruction.\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\nTo get started with Athabasca Recon, read the manual in [html format](http:athabasca_recon_manual.html), or download the [PDF version](http:athabasca_recon_manual_v1.3.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAthabasca Recon was originally developed by Eric Nodwell (@nodwell)\r\nat the Bone Imaging Laboratory,\r\nUniversity of Calgary (http://bonelab.ucalgary.ca/) under the supervision\r\nof Dr. Steven K. Boyd for the purpose of processing data synchrotron\r\ndata obtained at the Canadian Light Source. It is now supported and\r\nmaintained by Numerics88 Solutions Ltd. (http://numerics88.com./)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
