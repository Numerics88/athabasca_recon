Changes from version 1.2.2 to version 1.3
---------------------------------------

- Added option BilinearWithFallback to PixelInterpolation.  This is now the
default.  See the manual.

- Option Reconstruction.BrightFieldBadThreshold changed to
Reconstruction.FlatFieldBadThreshold.  (Previously it applied to the flat
field, even though it was named "bright".)


Changes from version 1.2 to version 1.2.2
---------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug where setting a projection stride > 1 results in garbage.  This
bug only affected Windows (is actually due to a Windows library bug).

- Note that reading/writing large files still only works correctly on Windows
if Visual Studio 10 (i.e. 2010) or newer is used to compile athabasca_recon.


Changes from version 1.1 to version 1.2
---------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug where writing output files larger than 2GB on Windows may
cause a crash.


Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1
---------------------------------------

- Fixed memory leak of volume memory on multiple passes.

- Default for MaximumVolumeMemory changed to system memory minus 1GB.

- Double buffered asynchronous file I/O is implemented.  In certain
scenarios (e.g. a stack of individual projection files), this can speed up
I/O.

- Better trapping and reporting of exceptions in worker threads.


Changes from version 0.4 to version 1.0
---------------------------------------

- Source code released.

- Back-projection is somewhat faster.


Changes from version 0.3 to version 0.4
---------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the length of real-space ramp kernel function.  As an example
of the magnitude of the error, in the example reconstruction of the synthetic
phantom in section 4.2 of the Manual, the sphere with attenuation density
0.004 was formerly reconstructed with an average attenuation density 0.004015.
After fixing this bug, it now reconstructs with average attenuation density
0.004004.

- No back-projection is performed on pixels outside of the cylindrical
reconstructable volume.  Voxels lying outside of this volume have some,
but not all, projections passing through them.  As a result they have
meaningless values.  They will now have identically zero value.  This has
no real impact on the meaningful part of the image, however there are two
possible minor benefits: (1) The images may appear to have better contrast,
as the range of intensities won't start at some meaningless negative value.
(2) a slight reduction in reconstruction times in some cases will be observed.


Changes from version 0.2 to version 0.3
---------------------------------------

- Enabled the option "BeforeAndAfterBrightField"
for +Reconstruction.BeamPowerCorrection+.  (Previously described in the
manual, but not actually enabled.)

- Allow the specification of a value for
Reconstruction.BeamPowerDecayConstantTerm with the
Reconstruction.BeamPowerCorrection methods "BeforeAndAfterBrightField" and
"ConstantTotalAttenuation".  (Previously described in the manual, but not
previously actually functional.)

- Addition of command-line option "--config" or "-c", which will print out
the complete configuration and then exit without performing any calculations
(eg. "athabasca_recon --config example.conf").

- The option "ZeroProjectionEdgeAttenuation" for
Reconstruction.BeamPowerCorrection has been renamed "NullProjectionEdge".
(For backwards compatibility, "ZeroProjectionEdgeAttenuation" is still
accepted.)

- Fixed a crash that occurred if the number of requested slices was fewer
than the number of threads.
