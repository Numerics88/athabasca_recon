# Athabasca Recon

Athabasca Recon is a program for CT reconstruction using filtered back-projection

Because it was created to process synchrotron tomographic data, it currently
only handles parallel beam reconstruction.

## Compilation and Manual

Instructions for compiling are found in the manual. The manual can be found
on-line at http://numerics88.github.io/athabasca_recon/ .

Alternatively, the manual is located in the source code in the doc
directory. It can be compiled with asciidoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).
If you have asciidoc installed, the manual can be build with
"make pdf" or "make html".

## Authors and Contributors

Athabasca Recon was originally developed by Eric Nodwell (@nodwell) at the
Bone Imaging Laboratory, University of Calgary (http://bonelab.ucalgary.ca/)
under the supervision of Dr. Steven K. Boyd for the purpose of processing
data synchrotron data obtained at the Canadian Light Source. It is now
supported and maintained by Numerics88 Solutions Ltd. (http://numerics88.com./)
